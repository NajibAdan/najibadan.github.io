### Data Visualization and Analysis

[Ford Go Bike](https://github.com/NajibAdan/UdacityxALX/tree/main/Project_003)

I used exploratory and explanatory visualizations based on the data available from the Ford Gobike share program in the San Francisco area to showcase: 
- How the trips were spread out geographically
- How gender, age and even membership can affect ride duration
- How the trips were distributed across the month and day.

[Investigating the Jouyou Kanji (常用漢字)](https://github.com/NajibAdan/Jouyou_Kanji_Analysis)

The Jouyou kanji (literally regular use Chinese Characters) are a list of kanji characters and readings annouced officially by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Currently it's a list of 2,136 characters but it's not an exhaustive list of all the kanjis in regular use. It is intended as a literacy baseline for those who have completed compulsory education, as well as a list of permitted characters and readings for use in official government documents.

### Data Engineering

[StackOverflow](https://github.com/NajibAdan/stack_overflow_data)

Using the StackOverflow API and Postgres, I created a data pipeline that fetches information about questions posted on StackOverflow and stores them to a Postgres Database.
