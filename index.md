I conducted a thorough EDA to identify the main factors influencing customer churn. I dealt with outliers, engineered new features, and used ensemble machine learning techniques to classify customers into churners and non-churners. I also evaluated different discount strategies and their effects on revenue.

I applied exploratory and explanatory data visualization techniques to the Ford Gobike share program data from the San Francisco area to reveal:

- The geographic distribution of trips
- The influence of gender, age and membership status on ride duration
- The variation of trips across month and day.

The Jouyou kanji (literally regular use Chinese Characters) are a list of kanji characters and readings annouced officially by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Currently it's a list of 2,136 characters but it's not an exhaustive list of all the kanjis in regular use. It is intended as a literacy baseline for those who have completed compulsory education, as well as a list of permitted characters and readings for use in official government documents.

Using the StackOverflow API and Postgres, I created a data pipeline that fetches information about questions posted on StackOverflow and stores them to a Postgres Database.
